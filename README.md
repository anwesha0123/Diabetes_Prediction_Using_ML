# Diabetes_Prediction_Using_ML

# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression & SVM

This project uses **Supervised Learning Algorithms** â€” Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) â€” to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various medical features. The best-performing model achieved **87% accuracy**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build an accurate, interpretable, and lightweight machine learning model for early prediction of diabetes using clinical input data.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- ðŸ“¥ Source: [Kaggle - Diabetes Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/code/chanchal24/diabetes-dataset-eda-prediction-with-7-models)
- ðŸ”¢ Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, Age, etc.
- ðŸŽ¯ Target: `Outcome` (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- ðŸ”¹ **Logistic Regression**
- ðŸ”¹ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

The model was evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with the best achieving **87% accuracy**.
